# THT_Bestueckung


## Description
This is a project that was implemented to automatically place THT components on a board. 
Here a cobot from Universal Robot with the RG2-FT gripper from OnRobot was used.
The components were gripped, then the wires were detected by machine vision and with this information and the defined hole position on the board, the components could be placed. 
A camera from Photoneo was used.
Various capacitors and fuses were successfully placed.
